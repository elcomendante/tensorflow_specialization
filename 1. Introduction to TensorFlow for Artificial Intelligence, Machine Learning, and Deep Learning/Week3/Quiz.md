1. What is a Convolution?

    - [ ] A technique to make images bigger
    - [ ] A technique to make images smaller
    - [x] A technique to isolate features in images
    - [ ] A technique to filter out unwanted images

2.  What is a Pooling?

    - [ ] A technique to make images sharper
    - [ ] A technique to combine pictures
    - [x] A technique to reduce the information in an image while maintaining features
    - [ ] A technique to isolate features in images

3. How do Convolutions improve image recognition?

    - [x] They isolate features in images
    - [ ] They make the image smaller
    - [ ] They make the image clearer
    - [ ] They make processing of images faster

4. After passing a 3x3 filter over a 28x28 image, how big will the output be?

    - [ ] 25x25
    - [x] 26x26
    - [ ] 28x28
    - [ ] 31x31

5. After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be?

    - [x] 13x13
    - [ ] 56x56
    - [ ] 26x26
    - [ ] 28x28

6. Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:

    - [ ] Faster
    - [ ] Slower
    - [x] It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!
